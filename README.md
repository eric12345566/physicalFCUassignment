# Physics assignment with python
This is the python program that simulation the assignment question with python and vpython. the question is down below:

> Revised from Problem 23.16, Young and > Freedman, 14th Edition.
> 
> Two stationary point charges +3.00 nC and +2.00 nC are separated by a distance of 50.0 cm. An electron is released from rest at a point midway between the two charges and moves along the line connecting the two charges. Find the speed of the electron when it is 10.0 cm from the charge +3.00 nC. Write a report to present your answers!


# Usage

the system requirement:
* python3
* vpython >= 7.5.0
* web browser (recommand  google chorme)

We assume that you have python3 in your OS (If you don't, please INTALL IT!!).

Now, that's install vpython:
    
    pip3 install vpython

and start the main.py with:

    python3 main.py

it will show in web browser (if you're os are windows, maybe will show with the native desktop screen).
